  <h1>London</h1>
  <h2>1 skyrius</h2>
  <p>
    London is the capital city of <u>England</u>. It is the most populous city in the
    <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.Standing on the
    <a href="https://www.visitthames.co.uk/about-the-river">River Thames</a>, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the <i>Romans</i>, who named it <i>Londinium.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    It was the <i>Romans</i> who were responsible for the city we know today as
    <b>London</b>. They invaded Britain in 1843, and soon afterwards founded the city of
    <i>Londinium</i>. It is thought that the original city was small - about the size of <q>Hyde Park!</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1860 <b>Queen Boudica</b> (also known as Boadicia) of the Iceni tribe rose up against the <i>Romans</i>, who fled. The city was burned to the ground. However, the <i>Romans</i> eventually regained control and rebuilt London, this time adding a
    <q>Forum</q> (market) and <q>Basilica</q> (a business centre), and slowly building a wall around the city to protect it from further invasion.

    Boudica has secured a special place of her own in British folk history remembered
  for her courage.</q>

  <p>The Warrior Queen who fought the might of Rome. And in a way she did get her revenge, as in 1902 a bronze statue of her riding high in her chariot, designed by Thomas Thorneycroft, was placed on the Thames embankment next to the Houses of Parliament
    in the old Roman capital of Britain, Londinium â€“ The ultimate in Girl Power!
